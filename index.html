            <p id="describle">Data science has become the revolutionary technology that everyone 
            seems to be talking about. Data science, dubbed "the sexiest job of the 21st 
            century," is such a buzzword that few people know what its technology really means. 
            Linkedin found in the latest survey of related occupations that machine learning and 
            data science engineers have surpassed traditional software engineers to become the 
            highest paid group, with a median annual salary of $129,000. IBM predicts that in 
            the next few years, the demand for data science jobs will soar by 28%. Nowadays, 
            Data Science is undoubtedly one of the most popular majors for studying abroad, 
            and the competition for data science majors is becoming increasingly fierce. 
            What to learn? How about employment?</p>

          <h4>Introduce：</h4>
          <p>First, we divide the income into three parts. When the income is lower 
            than 97279, it is represented by red; when the income is between 97279 
            and 194558, it is represented by blue; when the income is greater than 
            194558, it is represented by red. So in this image, marks have lines, 
            and channels have positions, colors, and sizes. <br>In this image, most 
            people work in California, or work remotely, and the income of the two most 
            people is generally between 97279 and 194558.</p>

          <p><h4>Introduce：</h4>Display the area as the shape of each state, and at 
            the same time this is the mark, and then use the color gradient to 
            distinguish the differences between the states and use it as channels. 
            <br>Taking a closer look, we can see that California and New York are the 
            two states with the largest population statistics.</p>
            <p>In addition, I use zoom in and out to make state of choose more easiler.</p>

          <p><h4>Introduce：</h4>Here, we use box plot to display, the vertical line 
            indicates the range of maximum income and minimum income, and the green 
            rectangle in the middle indicates the range income of 25% to 75%, so 
            marks have lines and areas, while channels have positions and shapes, 
            and area to represent. <br>In this picture, we have extracted the 
            departments and company categories with the largest number of people 
            through simple processing, and then through simple observation, we can 
            get that most of the data are extremely unevenly distributed, whether it 
            is the comparison between departments or the type. In comparison, the gap 
            between the maximum value and the minimum value is huge, and the median 
            line indicates that the income does not match the mean. The data between 
            25% and 75% is not in the center of each group of data, that is, it is not 
            normally distributed.</p>
